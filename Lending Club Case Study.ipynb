    "# Lending Club Case Study\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Objectives</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using EDA, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>How Objectives will be utilized?</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "When the company receives a loan application, based on above indicators, the company wants to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The decision should help in not losing the business to the company if the applicant is able to pay and at the same time, do not enter in to credit loss (financial loss) to the company if the applicant is not able to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "<strong>Assumptions</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The company allows a loan to remain delinquent for a period of time before considering it as default.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "<strong>Decisions</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Considering assumption 1, we are not considering the column 'mths_since_last_delinq' as part of dataset since our goal is to identify factors which can help even prior approving the loan but not after the applicant has delinquent the loan which happens once the loan is approved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br></br>\n",
    "<strong>Approach</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As a first step, ensure the dataset is clean. As we are not sure which parameter or variable (column) would have impact on defaulting, the approach objective is to retain clean data including whatever possible columns. <br>Here, we perform Data Cleaning Steps by following the checklist: Fix rows and columns, Missing Values, Standardise Numbers, Standardise Text, Fix Invalid Values and Filter Data\n",
    "2. Once the above master dataset is created, we try to make subsets appropriately to assess the impacts of variables.\n",
